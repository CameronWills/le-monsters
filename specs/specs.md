Build a side-scrolling 2D platform game suitable for 7-8 year old kids, named "Le Monsters"
Requirements for the game:
- Similar in feel and playing style to Super Mario Bros, but the main character will be an orange labubu-like character named 'Hugo'
- The game should only have one level, that should take between 4-6 mins to finish, with a boss character at the end of the level which is an monster with spiky legs.
- Throughout the level, there should be enemies such as birds and sharks that move along the ground, and main character can jump on their heads to kill them, or otherwise kill them by shooting a small ball of light from a magic wizards staff
- The main character does not have the wizards staff at the start, it can be collected by picking up a wizards hat that appears in the level.
- The player will have 3 lives to complete the game/level, restarting the last seen checkpoints throughout the level.
- The art style/direction should look like hand drawings and colouring in. At some later stage, I want to add some hand-drawn images for the main character, enemies and other sprites in the game.
- The game needs to run in a desktop browser such as Chrome, and does not need to be responsive or support mobile/tablet screen size devices
- The game should perform well enough on standard laptop devices.
- The game should have nice graphical startup screen with a menu, and an option to start a "New Game" as well as "About" describing the author and project.
