```

### 🎨 Current Visuals

All entities use placeholder graphics:
- **Hugo (Player)**: Orange 64x64 rectangle with "🧙" emoji
- **Platforms**: Brown rectangles (varying sizes)
- **Coins**: Yellow 24x24 circles
- **Checkpoints**: Red/Green flag sprites

### 💡 Developer Notes

#### Entity-Sprite Pattern
Each entity stores a reference to itself in the sprite's data:
```typescript
this.sprite.setData('entity', this);
```

This allows collision handlers to retrieve the entity from the sprite during physics overlaps.

#### Jump Buffering
The InputManager stores jump presses for 5 frames (83ms at 60fps), allowing players to jump shortly before landing for more responsive controls.

#### Checkpoint System
- Checkpoints save respawn position in GameStateManager
- Flag changes color (red → green) on activation
- Player respawns at last checkpoint after death
- Falls to level start if no checkpoint activated

#### Lives & Death
- Player starts with 3 lives (GAME_CONFIG.PLAYER_MAX_LIVES)
- Falling below level height triggers death
- 2-second delay before respawn
- Invincibility (1s, flashing) after respawn
- Game Over when lives reach 0 (currently just restarts scene)
